# [WIP] Yoga Buddy
Helper app for practising safe Yoga! This is a **work in progress**.

## What is Yoda Buddy?
When finished Yoga Buddy will assist users in finding and executing poses in a safe manner, including instructions and when/when not to perform certain poses. Yoga Buddy will also include a "Buddy" system where you can find people to practice yoga with, and places to practice yoga in, e.g. a local gym. 

## Key Features
- Easily find new Yoga poses that you would like to try.
- Filter Yoga poses by positives (core strength, calming, etc.) and negatives (bad for pregnant women or people with back problems, etc.).
- Multi-language.
- Integrates a CMS for easy editing of poses and translations by non-programmers.
- Automatic night/dark mode.
- Google Maps integration to easily find people to practice with and places to practice in.

## Reason
I hope that this project will show that I have a deep understanding of React Native and that I have experience working with React Native apps, both alone and in a team, from begining (sketch) to end (Play/App Store release).

To properly showcase this the programming-side of the app is heavily focused on using the latest technology within React and React Native. This includes the latest versions of popular packages such as `react-navigation` and using functional components + hooks instead of classes for React components. The project is also built with teamwork in mind, making sure to carefully separate work into Git branches and using [Trello](https://trello.com/) to keep track of what has to be worked on next, what is ready to be tested, and what is ready for release. A CMS is also used to ensure that data (new poses and translations) can can be added to the app without the need of a programmer.
